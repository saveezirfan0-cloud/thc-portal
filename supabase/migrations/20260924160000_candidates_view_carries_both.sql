-- onboarding_candidates_v carries both of the 24.09 changes
--
-- Two branches built in parallel each restated this view from the same
-- base: 20260924110000 (Willo / resend) made `activated` mean "the login
-- has a password" (staff_account_activated()), because Accept now links
-- the login before the candidate ever opens E3; 20260924130000 routed
-- rejection_reason through staff_rejection_reason_v. The later one won
-- and put `activated` back to "a login is linked", so every accepted
-- candidate read Activated (E3) again. This is 130000's view with 110000's
-- `activated`.
